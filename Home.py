# ARG & Internet Mystery Connection
st.subheader("Why is Cryptography Important in ARGs?")
st.write(
    "Many famous **ARGs (Alternate Reality Games)** use cryptography to hide messages, unlock new levels, "
    "or lead players down deep rabbit holes. Games like **Cicada 3301, The Wyoming Incident, and mysterious internet "
    "puzzles**"
    "have all used cryptographic techniques like the **Caesar and VigenÃ¨re ciphers** to test players' skills. "
    "By learning these techniques, youâ€™ll be prepared to tackle real internet mysteries!"
