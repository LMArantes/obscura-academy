## About the Project
Obscura Academy is an interactive **learning platform** designed for **beginners interested in cryptography, steganography, and coding**. Inspired by **ARGs (Alternate Reality Games)** and **internet mysteries**, this academy provides an engaging way to explore encryption, hidden messages, and digital forensics.

- **Learn fundamental cryptographic techniques** like the **Caesar cipher, VigenÃ¨re cipher, and substitution ciphers**.  
- **Explore steganography**, including **hiding text in images and SSTV encoding**.  
- **Develop basic coding skills** with **Python and HTML analysis**.  
- **Solve interactive challenges** where users must **decrypt messages, analyze files, and uncover hidden clues**.


## Features
- **Cryptography Lessons** â†’ Interactive explanations of classic ciphers.  
- **Steganography Exploration** â†’ Techniques for hiding and extracting messages from images and audio.  
- **File Analysis** â†’ Extract metadata, inspect hex data, and analyze file structures.  
- **Coding Basics** â†’ Learn Python, HTML, and useful developer tools.  
- **Interactive Challenges** â†’ Hands-on exercises to test and apply what you've learned.  
- **Built-in AI Assistant (The Oracle)** â†’ Ask cryptography-related questions and receive interactive challenges.  


## Built With
- **Python** â†’ Core logic for cryptographic functions and challenges.
- **Streamlit** â†’ Interactive web-based interface.
