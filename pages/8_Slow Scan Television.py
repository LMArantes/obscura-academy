st.write(
    "Slow Scan Television (SSTV) is a method of transmitting images using audio signals over radio frequencies. "
    "Unlike traditional television, which transmits continuous video at high frame rates, SSTV transmits still images "
    "line-by-line over a period of several seconds. This technique is widely used in **amateur radio, "
    "space communication, and scientific research.**"
)

st.subheader("Example: SSTV Transmission")
st.write(
    "Below is an example of an image transmitted using SSTV and its corresponding SSTV audio signal. "
    "You can **view the image and listen to the transmission audio** to understand how SSTV works."

st.write(
    "This audio file represents the sound generated when transmitting the above image via **SSTV Martin 1**. "
    "If decoded correctly, this sound would reconstruct the image at the receiving end."
)

st.subheader("Historical Background")
st.write(
    "SSTV was developed in the late 1950s as a way for amateur radio operators (HAM radio users) to send images over "
    "radio waves. It was quickly adopted by space agencies, including **NASA, which used SSTV to transmit images from "
    "early space missions.**"

### **Key Historical Milestones:**
- **1957** - First SSTV experiments conducted using analog television standards.
- **1966** - NASA‚Äôs Lunar Orbiter missions use SSTV to send images of the Moon back to Earth.
- **1969** - Apollo 11‚Äôs Moon landing images were transmitted via SSTV before being converted to standard TV format.
- **Present Day** - The International Space Station (ISS) still uses SSTV to broadcast images to Earth via HAM radio.

st.subheader("How Does SSTV Work?")
st.write(
    "SSTV transmits images as **audio frequencies**, encoding pixel brightness levels into sound waves. The receiver "
    "interprets these signals and reconstructs the image line-by-line. Different SSTV modes (such as **Robot 36, "
    "Scottie, and Martin**) vary in resolution and transmission time."
)

st.markdown(
    """
### **Steps in an SSTV Transmission:**
1. **Image Preparation** - The image is converted into a format compatible with SSTV.
2. **Audio Signal Generation** - The image data is modulated into audio tones.
3. **Transmission** - The audio signal is transmitted over radio frequencies or stored as a sound file.
4. **Decoding & Reconstruction** - A receiving station interprets the audio and reconstructs the image.

st.subheader("Modern Uses of SSTV")

st.markdown(
    """
##### **Applications of SSTV Today:**
- **Amateur Radio (HAM Radio)** - Enthusiasts use SSTV to communicate and share images worldwide.
- **Scientific Research** - SSTV is used to send environmental and meteorological data from remote locations.
- **Aviation & Maritime Communication** - Transmitting images in areas where internet access is limited.
- **Space Exploration** - The International Space Station (ISS) periodically broadcasts images to HAM radio operators on Earth.

st.subheader("How SSTV Differs from Traditional Steganography")
st.write(
    "While SSTV is not a steganographic method in itself, it shares some similarities with covert communication "
    "techniques. It allows images to be **transmitted as disguised audio signals**, making it an interesting way to "
    "store and transport visual data without direct image transmission. This makes SSTV useful in scenarios where "
    "traditional data transfer methods are unavailable."
